KNN(X, Y, letters, n)
1   k = sqrt(length(letters)*n)
2   let D be a hashmap that maps all training samples to their distances from the test sample
3   compute the centroid for the test sample using X and Y, respecively
4   for each letter i in letters
5       for j in [1...n]
6           query the sample training letter ij from training set
7           get the centroid for the current training sample
8           calculate the Euclidean distance between the sample training letter and the test sample
9   sort D based on increasing distances
10  let K be the list of the first k letters from D
11  return the first mode encountered in K
