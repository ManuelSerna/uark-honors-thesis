3   let (Xc, Yc) be the test sample centroid
4   for each letter i in letters
5       for j in [1...n]
6           query the sample training letter ij from training set
7           let (Xij, Yij) be the centroid for the current training sample
8           let (Dx, Dy) be the Euclidean distance between (Xc, Yc) and (Xij, Yij)

10  sort D based on increasing distances
11  let K be the list of the first k letters from D
12  return the first mode encountered in K
