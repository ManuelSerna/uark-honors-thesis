Observations and Notes

* Tracking colored object
    - This type of tracker works best when the background:
        - is simple
	    - if it is not, then the tracker may identify a random corner as the marker
	- color is distinct from hand color
    - Lighting is an issue. 
	- too little
	- too much
	- both issues interfere with color thresholding
    - There is also the issue of the contours missrepresenting the drawing marker and
instead marking another edge.
    - Solution: adjust the lower limits for hsv thresholding, and use a very-neon-colored
object to draw with. The color that works best for me is a neon-green capped marker.
