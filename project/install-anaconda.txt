Install Anaconda distribution (on Linux Manjaro)

In order to use deep learning as one of my classification methods, I will need to use the Keras machine learning library. The way I intend to do this is after running the other classifiers, the SCRIPT changes the Python interpreter to Anaconda's Python 3.6. Keras only works with Python 3.6 at the latest. After outputting the classification result, revert back to the system's interpreter. It's not the best solution, but it works.

This installation process works as of March, 2020.



Installation steps
1) Go to the Downloads page: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux

2) Run the script to install
    $ chmod 755 xxx.sh
    $ ./xxx.sh
    
3) Update Anaconda if necessary using
    $ conda update -n base conda

4) Downgrade to Python 3.6, the latest version compatible with Keras
    $ conda install python=3.6

5) Now, we will very likely have to install OpenCV (cv2) to Anaconda. Here is the site I used to get cv2 installed:

        https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv
        
    Or go here (general):
        
        https://anaconda.org

    To install cv2:
        
        $ conda install -c conda-forge opencv
    
    I ran into an error when trying to import cv2, the below command fixed it:
        
        $ conda install -c defaults libprotobuf protobuf
    
    After this I can import cv2 in python 3.6. I will use this only to get the image training and testing data.

6) Now Anaconda modified the .bashrc file so now when we use the 'python' command we use Anaconda3's python interpreter. This causes issues when using OpenCV as the downgrade causes several functions to change. I decided to instead swicth between the two interpreters--the system's (I currently have Python 3.8) and Anaconda's (Python 3.6).

Modify the file .bashrc, in the last line I should find a line that looks like:

    export PATH="/home/manuel/Programming/packages/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

Change it so it says:

    export PATH="/usr/bin/:$PATH"

7) Now with the .bashrc file fixed, we can now switch between the anaconda3 and system Pyton interpreters with ease. If we want to switch to anaconda and back to the system, follow the below template script.
    
    # start of scritpt
    # ...
    
    # switch to anaconda interpreter
    export PATH="/home/manuel/Programming/packages/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    
    # work ...

    export PATH="/usr/bin/:$PATH"
    
    # more work ...
